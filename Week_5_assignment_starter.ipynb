    "- create a Python script/file/module with a function that takes a pandas dataframe as an input and returns the probability of churn for each row in the dataframe\n",

    "- use other autoML packages, such as TPOT, H2O, MLBox, etc, and compare performance and features with pycaret\n",
    "- create a class in your Python module to hold the functions that you created\n",
    "- accept user input to specify a file using a tool such as Python's `input()` function, the `click` package for command-line arguments, or a GUI\n",
    "- Use the unmodified churn data (new_unmodified_churn_data.csv) in your Python script. This will require adding the same preprocessing steps from week 2 since this data is like the original unmodified dataset from week 1."

    "First, the required packages were installed, and the necessary PyCaret modules were imported to set up the AutoML environment. Various classifiers were evaluated to predict churn, and since AUC is a key metric, the Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC) was chosen with an AUC of 0.8289, slightly higher than Logistic Regression's 0.8273. The best model was saved as best_model.pkl, along with its preprocessing pipeline. When applied to the new dataset, new_churn_data.csv, the model predicted \"No Churn\" for all instances, while the actual values were [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]. This indicates that the model failed to identify any churning cases, highlighting the need for further refinement to improve its predictive capabilities. Overall, this process illustrates the steps of training a model, saving it, and using it for churn predictions.\n"
